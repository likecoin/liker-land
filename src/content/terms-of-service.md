## 1) Introduction

Liker Land, owned and operated by Liker Land Inc., doing business as Liker Land ("Liker Land," "we," "us," or "our"), welcomes you. These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your access to and use of the Liker Land website(s), our APIs, mobile applications ("App"), and any live support, software, tools, features, or functionalities provided on or in connection with our services, collectively referred to as the "Service." By accessing and using the Service, you agree to be legally bound by these Terms and all terms incorporated herein by reference. Please carefully read these Terms as they contain important information that affects your legal rights.

For the purposes of these Terms, the terms "user," "you," and "your" refer to you as the user of the Service. If you are using the Service on behalf of a company or another entity, "you" also includes that entity. By using the Service, you represent and warrant that you are an authorized representative of the entity and have the authority to bind the entity to these Terms.

It is important to note that these Terms include a mandatory arbitration agreement and class action waiver, as described in Section 16, which generally requires disputes between us to be resolved through individual arbitration instead of in court by a judge or jury. Therefore, please review these Terms carefully as they affect your legal rights.

To provide clarity, "NFT" in these Terms refers to a non-fungible token or a similar digital item implemented on a blockchain, such as the Ethereum blockchain. These tokens use smart contracts to link to or be associated with specific content or data.

Liker Land operates as a peer-to-peer web3 service that facilitates users in discovering and directly interacting with each other and NFTs on public blockchains. However, we do not function as a wallet provider, exchange, broker, dealer, financial institution, payments processor, money services business, or creditor. We do not possess custody or control over the NFTs or blockchains with which you interact, and we do not execute or facilitate purchases, transfers, or sales of NFTs. To use our Service, you must utilize a third-party wallet that enables transactions on blockchains.

Liker Land is not a party to any agreements between users. Consequently, you are solely responsible for verifying the identity, legitimacy, and authenticity of NFTs purchased from third-party sellers using the Service. We make no claims, guarantees, or recommendations regarding the identity, legitimacy, functionality, or authenticity of users or NFTs (including associated content) visible on the Service.

Given the expanding range of our services, we may occasionally provide additional terms for specific services. These additional terms become part of your agreement with us if you use the corresponding services. In case of any conflict between these Terms and additional terms applicable to a specific service, the additional terms will govern that particular service.

We reserve the right to change or modify these Terms at our sole discretion. If there are significant changes, we will make reasonable efforts to notify you of such changes through the Service or by updating the "Last Updated" date at the beginning of these Terms. By continuing to access or use the Service, you acknowledge and agree to the revised Terms and all terms incorporated therein by reference, effective from the date these Terms are updated. It is your sole responsibility to periodically review the Terms to stay informed of any changes and to ensure your understanding of the terms and conditions applicable when accessing or using the Service.

## 2) Accessing the Service

When accessing Liker Land, your blockchain address serves as your identity, much like in web3. Therefore, you'll need a third-party wallet and a blockchain address to access the Service. Your Account on the Service will be associated with your blockchain address. If you want to personalize your Liker Land persona, you have the option to add additional information, such as a profile picture, to your Account.

Your Account on Liker Land will display the NFTs associated with your linked blockchain address, along with any related content. When using your wallet in connection with the Service, you agree to abide by the terms and conditions of the wallet provider. Please note that wallets are independent of Liker Land, and we have no custody or control over their contents. Therefore, we accept no responsibility or liability for your wallet or its contents. It is crucial that you keep your wallet secure and never share your wallet credentials or seed phrase with anyone. If you encounter any wallet-related issues, please contact your wallet provider. Similarly, you are solely responsible for your Account and associated wallet, and we cannot be held liable for any actions or compromises resulting from your Account or wallet. If you discover or suspect any security issues regarding the Service or your Account, please notify us immediately.

By using the Service, you affirm that you will comply with all applicable laws. To fulfill our legal obligations and maintain the safety of our platform and users, we may need to restrict, suspend, or terminate your access to the Service. Please understand that we are not obligated to disclose the details of such actions to you.

Furthermore, by using the Service, you warrant and represent that: (a) you are not located in or subject to the laws of any jurisdiction that is under a comprehensive U.S. Government embargo ("Embargoed Jurisdiction"); (b) you are not subject to any sanctions imposed by the U.S. Government, any other government, or the United Nations ("Sanctions"); (c) you are not directly or indirectly owned or controlled by any person subject to Sanctions or located in an Embargoed Jurisdiction; (d) none of your officers, managers, directors, shareholders, or authorized representatives are subject to Sanctions or located in an Embargoed Jurisdiction, nor are they owned or controlled, directly or indirectly, by any person subject to Sanctions or located in an Embargoed Jurisdiction; (e) you have not and will not transact with any person or entity falling into any of the categories mentioned above; (f) you have not and will not transact for the benefit of any person or entity falling into any of the categories mentioned above. You guarantee that the foregoing statements will remain true throughout the duration of this agreement. If you access or use the Service outside the United States, it is your sole responsibility to ensure compliance with applicable laws in the respective country, territory, or jurisdiction.

Under certain circumstances, Liker Land may request additional information and documents, as dictated by any applicable law or regulation, at the request of a government authority, to provide a requested service, or to investigate a potential violation of these Terms. In such cases, Liker Land reserves the right, at its sole discretion, to disable your Account and restrict your access to the Service until the requested information and documents are processed. Failure to provide complete and accurate information in response to such requests may result in Liker Land refusing to restore your access to the Service.

Please note that your access and use of the Service may be periodically interrupted due to various reasons, such as equipment malfunctions, routine updates, maintenance or repairs, geographic restrictions, potential violations of these Terms, or other actions that Liker Land, in its sole discretion, may choose to take. You acknowledge that Liker Land, at its sole discretion, may disable your Account and, if necessary, reassign your username or associated URL.

To ensure the safety and compliance of our platform, we require all users to be at least 18 years old. If you are between 13 and 18 years old, you may only use Liker Land under the supervision and approval of a parent or guardian who holds an Account. The account holder assumes responsibility for your actions on the platform. Please note that the use of our Service is strictly prohibited for individuals under the age of 13.

We value your understanding and adherence to these terms as they govern your access and use of the Service. By using Liker Land, you signify your agreement to these terms and affirm that you will comply with them. Failure to agree to these terms prohibits your access and use of the Service.

You are prohibited from using any metatags or hidden text that include "Liker Land" or any other name, trademark, or product or service name associated with Liker Land without our explicit written consent. Additionally, the distinctive "look and feel" of the Service is our service mark, trademark, or trade dress, and unauthorized copying, imitation, or use of it is strictly prohibited.

Any trademarks, registered trademarks, or product names of third parties mentioned on the Service or associated with NFTs displayed on the Service belong to their respective owners and may not be copied, imitated, or used without permission from the relevant intellectual property rights holder. Mention of any products, services, processes, or other information does not constitute or imply endorsement, sponsorship, or recommendation by Liker Land.

You acknowledge and agree that Liker Land may use and disclose Feedback in any manner and for any purpose without further notice or compensation to you, and you do not retain any proprietary or other rights or claims to the Feedback. By providing Feedback, you assign to Liker Land all right, title, and interest, including intellectual property rights, you may have in the Feedback.

Please be aware that Liker Land does not exercise ownership, custody, or control over NFTs or the smart contracts created by third parties. The creators of these NFTs or smart contracts are solely responsible for their operation and functionality.

## 4) **License to Access and Use Our Service and Content**

Subject to your compliance with these Terms, Liker Land Inc. grants you a limited, nontransferable, nonexclusive, nonsublicensable, and personal license to access and utilize the Service. This license allows you to access and display any software, content, or materials owned, controlled, or licensed by us that are distributed or made available to you as part of your use of the Service. The granted right and license are non-commercial, personal, non-assignable, non-sublicensable, non-transferrable, and non-exclusive.

This license enables you to access and display the aforementioned software, content, and materials, as well as download a single copy of the App onto your applicable device or equipment. The purpose of this license is solely to facilitate your use of the Service in accordance with these Terms. However, please note that your license to access and use any content linked to or associated with any NFTs is determined solely by the respective seller or creator of such NFT.

## 5) **Third-Party Content, Agreements, and Services**

Liker Land Inc. operates as a peer-to-peer web3 service that facilitates your exploration of NFTs created by third parties and enables interaction with various blockchains. It is important to note that Liker Land does not provide any warranties or assurances regarding the third-party content accessible through our Service, including any content associated with NFTs showcased on the platform. Therefore, you assume the responsibility of verifying the legitimacy, authenticity, and legality of NFTs purchased from third-party sellers. Additionally, we cannot guarantee the continuous visibility, availability, or transactional capabilities of any NFTs on Liker Land. Users hold sole responsibility for the content associated with their NFTs.

These Terms exclusively govern your use of our Service. NFTs are available on public blockchains and can be bought, sold, or transferred directly between buyers, sellers, and/or creators without utilizing our Service or agreeing to our Terms. There may be specific terms and conditions, known as "NFT Terms," established directly between buyers, sellers, and/or creators concerning the NFT itself. These NFT Terms pertain to the usage of the NFT content and encompass the associated rights and obligations. When you click to obtain more details about any NFTs or NFT collections visible on Liker Land or view the NFT metadata, you may encounter a third-party link directing you to the NFT Terms, which you must comply with. It is important to note that Liker Land does not dictate the NFT Terms and is not a party to any such agreements, as they are solely between the buyer, seller, and/or creator. It is the responsibility of the buyer, seller, and/or creator to communicate, establish, agree upon, and enforce the NFT Terms. It is essential for you to review these NFT Terms thoroughly.

Sellers hold exclusive responsibility for determining the price of an NFT, including any applicable taxes. Moreover, they are solely accountable for any mint count and minting mechanics associated with the NFTs they offer for sale.

Liker Land may receive certain fees for its Service. However, it does not establish, collect, or determine the additional costs, fees, and expenses associated with buying and selling NFTs. These expenses may include creator earnings, gas fees, or transaction fees, which are directly paid to the seller, creator, payment processor, blockchain validator, or other relevant third parties. As these costs, fees, and expenses are not collected by Liker Land, we cannot provide refunds for them.

The Service may incorporate links or features that enable access to third-party websites ("Third-Party Websites") and applications ("Third-Party Applications"), or provide access to third-party content, data, information, services, applications, or materials ("Third-Party Materials"). When you click on a link to access a Third-Party Website or Third-Party Application, please be aware that you are subject to the terms and conditions, including privacy policies, of a separate website or destination. These Third-Party Websites, Third-Party Applications, and Third-Party Materials are beyond the control of Liker Land Inc. and may be "open" applications that offer no recourse. We assume no responsibility or liability for any Third-Party Websites, Third-Party Applications, or Third-Party Materials. Liker Land merely provides links to Third-Party Websites and Third-Party Applications for convenience and does not review, approve, monitor, endorse, warrant, or make any representations regarding these external sources or their products, services, or associated materials. It is your responsibility to use any links in Third-Party Websites, Third-Party Applications, or Third-Party Materials at your own risk.

## 11) **Disclaimers**

Please note that your access to and use of the Service is at your own risk. Liker Land Inc. understands and agrees that the Service is provided on an "as is" and "as available" basis, and we expressly disclaim any warranties or conditions, whether express or implied.

(a) We do not guarantee that the Service will meet your requirements.
(b) We cannot ensure uninterrupted, timely, secure, or error-free access to the Service.
(c) We do not warrant the accuracy, reliability, completeness, legality, or safety of the Service.
(d) We disclaim all other warranties or conditions, including implied warranties or conditions of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, title, and non-infringement.
(e) Liker Land Inc. will not be liable for any loss resulting from actions taken or reliance placed on material or information contained on the Service.

While Liker Land Inc. strives to ensure the safety of your access to and use of the Service, we cannot guarantee that the Service, its content, content linked to or associated with any NFTs, or any NFTs you interact with using our Service or our service providers' servers are free of viruses or other harmful components. We cannot guarantee the security of any data you disclose online. Any advice or information obtained from Liker Land Parties or through the Service does not create any warranty or representation not expressly stated herein. You accept the inherent security risks of providing information and conducting online transactions over the Internet and will not hold Liker Land Inc. responsible for any security breaches.

Liker Land Inc. will not be responsible or liable for any loss related to your use of NFTs, content, and/or content linked to or associated with NFTs, including but not limited to losses, damages, or claims arising from:

(a) User errors, incorrectly constructed transactions, or mistyped addresses.
(b) Server failure or data loss.
(c) Unauthorized access or use.
(d) Unauthorized third-party activities, including viruses, phishing, brute-forcing, or other means of attacking the Service or NFTs.

Please be aware that NFTs exist solely based on the ownership record maintained in the associated blockchain (e.g., Ethereum network). Any transfers or sales occur on the associated blockchain (e.g., Ethereum). Liker Land Inc. and/or any other Liker Land Party cannot control the transfer of title or rights in any NFTs or their underlying or associated content or items.

No Liker Land Party is responsible or liable for sustained losses or injuries due to vulnerabilities or any kind of failure, abnormal behavior of software (e.g., wallet, smart contract), blockchains, or any other features of the NFTs. No Liker Land Party is responsible for losses or injuries resulting from delayed reports or no reports at all by developers or representatives regarding any issues with the blockchain supporting the NFTs, including forks, technical node issues, or any other issues resulting in losses or injuries.

Please note that some jurisdictions may not allow the exclusion of implied warranties in contracts with consumers, so the above exclusion may not apply to you.

## 12) **Assumption of Risk**

Here are the terms rearranged in bullet point format with the requested changes:

- The value of an NFT is subjective. Prices of NFTs are subject to volatility and fluctuations in the price of cryptocurrency can also materially and adversely affect NFT prices. You acknowledge that you fully understand this subjectivity and volatility and that you may lose money.
- You understand that you are responsible for any fees related to use of the Service, including for actions you take on the blockchain, regardless of whether a successful transaction occurs, and that such fees are final and irreversible.
- A lack of use or public interest in the creation and development of distributed ecosystems could negatively impact the development of those ecosystems and related applications, and could therefore also negatively impact the potential utility of NFTs.
- The regulatory regime governing blockchain technologies, non-fungible tokens, cryptocurrency, and other crypto-based items is uncertain, and new regulations or policies may materially adversely affect the development of the Service and the utility of NFTs.
- You are solely responsible for determining what, if any, taxes apply to your transactions and to withhold, collect, report, and remit the correct amounts of taxes to the appropriate tax authorities. Liker Land Inc. is not responsible for determining, withholding, collecting, reporting, or remitting any taxes that apply to your NFTs or the sale/purchase of your NFTs.
- There are risks associated with purchasing items associated with content created by third parties through peer-to-peer transactions, including but not limited to, the risk of purchasing counterfeit items, mislabeled items, items that are vulnerable to metadata decay, items on smart contracts with bugs, and items that may become untransferable. You represent and warrant that you have done sufficient research before making any decisions to sell, obtain, transfer, or otherwise interact with any NFTs or accounts/collections.
- We do not have ownership or control of the smart contracts deployed by third parties, and are not responsible and make no guarantees regarding their operation and functionality.
- We do not control the public blockchains that you are interacting with and we do not control certain smart contracts and protocols that may be integral to your ability to complete transactions on these public blockchains. Additionally, blockchain transactions are irreversible and Liker Land Inc. has no ability to reverse any transactions on the blockchain.
- There are risks associated with using Internet and blockchain-based products, including, but not limited to, the risk associated with hardware, software, and Internet connections, the risk of malicious software introduction, and the risk that third parties may obtain unauthorized access to your third-party wallet or Account. You accept and acknowledge that Liker Land Inc. will not be responsible for any communication failures, disruptions, errors, distortions, or delays you may experience when using the Service or any Blockchain network, however caused.
- The Service relies on third-party platforms and/or vendors. If we are unable to maintain a good relationship with such platform providers and/or vendors; if the terms and conditions or pricing of such platform providers and/or vendors change; if we violate or cannot comply with the terms and conditions of such platforms and/or vendors; or if any of such platforms and/or vendors lose market share or fall out of favor or become unavailable for a prolonged period of time, access to and use of the Service will suffer.
- Liker Land Inc. reserves the right to hide collections, contracts, and items affected by any of these issues or by other issues. Items you purchase may become inaccessible on Liker Land. Under no circumstances shall the inability to view items on Liker Land or an inability to use the Service in conjunction with the purchase, sale, or transfer of items available on any blockchains serve as grounds for a claim against Liker Land Inc.
- If you have a dispute with one or more users, YOU RELEASE US FROM CLAIMS, DEMANDS, AND DAMAGES OF EVERY KIND AND NATURE, KNOWN AND UNKNOWN, ARISING OUT OF OR IN ANY WAY CONNECTED WITH SUCH DISPUTES. IN ENTERING INTO THIS RELEASE, YOU EXPRESSLY WAIVE ANY PROTECTIONS (WHETHER STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE) THAT WOULD OTHERWISE LIMIT THE COVERAGE OF THIS RELEASE TO INCLUDE THOSE CLAIMS WHICH YOU MAY KNOW OR SUSPECT TO EXIST IN YOUR FAVOR AT THE TIME OF AGREEING TO THIS RELEASE.

## 13) **Limitation of Liability**

Access to and use of the service, products, or third-party sites and products provided by Liker Land Inc. are entirely at your own discretion and risk. You acknowledge and agree, to the fullest extent permitted by law, that Liker Land Inc. and its service providers shall not be liable to you or any third party under any circumstances. This includes any indirect, consequential, exemplary, incidental, special, or punitive damages arising from these terms, the service, products, or third-party sites and products. Furthermore, Liker Land Inc. and its service providers shall not be liable for any damages related to loss of revenue, loss of profits, loss of business or anticipated savings, loss of use, loss of goodwill, or loss of data.

It is important to note that these limitations on liability apply whether the damages are caused by strict liability or tort (including negligence), breach of contract, or any other legal theory. Even if Liker Land Inc. or its service providers have been advised of the possibility of such damages, they will not be held responsible. Additionally, Liker Land Inc. and its service providers shall not be liable for any other claim, demand, or damages resulting from or arising out of or in connection with these terms or the delivery, use, or performance of the service.

In no event shall the maximum aggregate liability of Liker Land Inc. arising out of or in any way related to these terms, the access to and use of the service, content, NFTs, or any Liker Land Inc. products or services exceed the greater of $100 or the amount received by Liker Land Inc. for its service directly relating to the items that are the subject of the claim. This limitation on liability shall apply even if the above-stated remedy fails of its essential purpose.

Please be aware that the exclusion or limitation of incidental or consequential damages may not be allowed in some jurisdictions. As a result, the above limitation or exclusion may not apply to you. Additionally, certain jurisdictions may impose limitations on disclaimers or limitations of liability for personal injury arising from consumer products, which may affect personal injury claims.

## 16) **Dispute Resolution; Arbitration**

### Dispute Resolution

- Please carefully read the following arbitration agreement in this Section ("Arbitration Agreement"). It requires you to arbitrate disputes with Liker Land and limits the manner in which you can seek relief from us. This section does not govern disputes between users or between users and third parties. Liker Land does not provide dispute resolution services for such disagreements, and the parties must resolve those disputes directly.

### Applicability of Arbitration Agreement

- You agree that any dispute, controversy, or claim relating in any way to your access or use of the Service, to any products sold or distributed through the Service, or to any aspect of your relationship with Liker Land Inc., will be resolved by binding arbitration, rather than in court. This includes threshold questions of the arbitrability of such dispute, controversy, or claim. However, you or Liker Land Inc. may assert claims in small claims court, but only if the claims qualify, remain only in such court, and are on an individual, non-representative, and non-class basis. You or Liker Land Inc. may also seek injunctive or equitable relief in a court of proper jurisdiction if the claim relates to intellectual property infringement or other misuse of intellectual property rights.

### Dispute Resolution Process

- Both you and Liker Land Inc. agree to engage in good-faith efforts to resolve disputes prior to either party initiating an arbitration, small claims court proceeding, or equitable relief for intellectual property infringement. To initiate this dispute resolution process, you must send a letter describing the nature of your claim and desired resolution to: Liker Land, Attn: Legal Department, 228 Park Avenue South, #22014, New York, NY 10003. Both parties agree to meet and confer personally, by telephone, or by videoconference ("Conference") to discuss the dispute and attempt in good faith to reach a mutually beneficial outcome that avoids the expenses of arbitration or, where applicable, litigation. If you are represented by counsel, your counsel may participate in the Conference as well, but you agree to fully participate in the Conference. Likewise, if Liker Land Inc. is represented by counsel, its counsel may participate in the Conference as well, but Liker Land Inc. agrees to have a company representative fully participate in the Conference. The statute of limitations and any filing fee deadlines shall be tolled while the parties engage in the informal dispute resolution process and Conference required by this paragraph. If the parties do not reach an agreement to resolve the dispute within thirty (30) days after initiation of this dispute resolution process, either party may commence arbitration, file an action in small claims court, or file a claim for injunctive or equitable relief in a court of proper jurisdiction for matters relating to intellectual property infringement, if the claims qualify.

### Arbitration Rules and Forum

- The interpretation and enforcement of this Arbitration Agreement are governed by the Federal Arbitration Act. To begin an arbitration proceeding after participating in the dispute resolution process, you must send a letter requesting arbitration and describing your claim to our registered agent at Liker Land, Attn: Legal Department, 228 Park Avenue South, #22014, New York, NY 10003. The arbitration will be conducted by JAMS, an established alternative dispute resolution provider. Disputes involving claims and counterclaims under $250,000, not inclusive of attorneys' fees, interest, claimed punitive or other damages, or any claim in excess of the bona fide verifiable value of actual lost property, shall be subject to JAMS's most current version of the Streamlined Arbitration Rules and the JAMS Consumer Minimum Standards then in effect. All other claims shall be subject to JAMS's most current version of the Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures and the JAMS Consumer Minimum Standards then in effect. You can find JAMS's rules at jamsadr.com or by calling JAMS at 800-352-5267. If JAMS is unavailable to arbitrate, the parties will select an alternative arbitral forum. If the arbitrator finds that you cannot afford to pay JAMS filing, administrative, hearing, and/or other fees and cannot obtain a waiver from JAMS, Liker Land Inc. will cover those fees for you if you complied with the dispute resolution process set forth above. Additionally, Liker Land Inc. will reimburse all such JAMS filing, administrative, hearing, and/or other fees for claims totaling less than $10,000 unless (a) a resolution of your claim results in a smaller monetary judgment than Liker Land Inc. may have offered you to settle the claim, at any point, or (b) the arbitrator determines the claims are frivolous or you did not comply with the dispute resolution process set forth above. However, if you initiated the arbitration claim, you will still be required to pay the lesser of $250 or the maximum amount permitted under the JAMS Rules for arbitration claims initiated by you. You are responsible for all additional costs incurred in the arbitration, including fees for attorneys or expert witnesses. You may choose to have the arbitration conducted by telephone or videoconference, based on written submissions, in person in your hometown area (if you live in the United States), or at another mutually agreed-upon location that is reasonably convenient to you. Any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.

### Authority of Arbitrator

- The arbitrator has exclusive authority to (a) determine the scope and enforceability of this Arbitration Agreement and (b) resolve any dispute related to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability, or formation of this Arbitration Agreement. This includes any claim that all or any part of this Arbitration Agreement is void or voidable. The arbitration will decide the rights and liabilities, if any, of you and Liker Land Inc. The arbitration proceeding will not be consolidated with any other matters or joined with any other cases or parties. The arbitrator has the authority to grant motions dispositive of all or part of any claim, award monetary damages, and grant any non-monetary remedy or relief available to an individual under applicable law, the arbitral forum's rules, and these Terms. The arbitrator will issue a written award and statement of decision describing the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based, including the calculation of any damages awarded. The arbitrator has the same authority to award relief on an individual basis as a judge in a court of law. The arbitrator's award is final and binding upon you and us.

### Waiver of Jury Trial

- YOU AND LIKER LAND HEREBY WAIVE ANY CONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY RIGHTS TO SUE IN COURT AND HAVE A TRIAL IN FRONT OF A JUDGE OR A JURY. Instead, all claims and disputes shall be resolved through arbitration under this Arbitration Agreement, except as specified in the second bullet of Section 16, above ("Applicability of Arbitration Agreement"). An arbitrator can award on an individual basis the same damages and relief as a court and must follow these Terms as a court would. However, arbitration does not involve a judge or jury, and court review of an arbitration award is subject to very limited review.

### Waiver of Class Actions and Class Arbitrations

- ALL CLAIMS AND DISPUTES WITHIN THE SCOPE OF THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT MUST BE ARBITRATED ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT ON A REPRESENTATIVE OR COLLECTIVE CLASS BASIS. Only individual relief is available, and claims of more than one user, person, or entity cannot be arbitrated or consolidated with those of any other user, person, or entity. Accordingly, an arbitrator shall not combine or consolidate more than one party's claims without the written consent of all affected parties to an arbitration proceeding. This includes class arbitration, which shall not proceed without the written consent of all affected parties. If a decision is issued stating that applicable law precludes enforcement of any part of these limitations as to a given claim for relief, then that claim must be severed from the arbitration and brought in the state or federal courts located in New York County, State of New York. All other claims shall be arbitrated.
- Severability
  - Except as provided in this section, if any part or parts of this Arbitration Agreement are found under the law to be invalid or unenforceable, then those specific part or parts shall have no force and effect, and they shall be severed. The remainder of the Arbitration Agreement shall continue to be in full force and effect.
- Survival of Agreement
  - This Arbitration Agreement will remain in effect even after the termination of your relationship with Liker Land Inc.
- Modification
  - Despite any provision in these Terms to the contrary, if Liker Land Inc. makes any future material changes to this Arbitration Agreement, you have the right to reject those changes within thirty (30) days of their effective date. To reject the changes, you must write to Liker Land Inc. at the following address: Liker Land Inc., Attn: Legal Department, 228 Park Avenue South, #22014, New York, NY 10003.

## 17) **Governing Law and Venue**

### Governing Law and Jurisdiction

- These Terms, as well as your access to and use of the Service, shall be governed by, construed, and enforced in accordance with the laws of the State of New York, without regard to conflict of law rules or principles of the State of New York or any other jurisdiction. The application of laws from any other jurisdiction is not considered.
- Any dispute between the parties that is not subject to arbitration as set forth in Section 16 or cannot be heard in small claims court shall be resolved in the state or federal courts of New York County in the State of New York, and the United States, respectively, sitting in the State of New York.

- It will not affect the validity or enforceability of any remaining part of that term, clause, or provision, or any other term, clause, or provision of these Terms.

## 20) **Injunctive Relief**

- You agree that a breach of these Terms will cause irreparable injury to Liker Land Inc for which monetary damages would not be an adequate remedy.

- By using the Service, you represent and warrant that you are not located in any such country or on any such list.
- You are responsible for and hereby agree to comply at your sole expense with all applicable United States export laws and regulations.

## 23) Survival

- All sections which by their nature should survive the termination of these Terms shall continue in full force and effect subsequent to and notwithstanding any termination of these Terms by Liker Land Inc or you.
- Termination will not limit any of Liker Land Inc's other rights or remedies at law or in equity.

## 24) Miscellaneous

- These Terms (and any other applicable terms or policies incorporated by reference in these Terms) constitute the entire agreement between you and Liker Land relating to your access to and use of the Service.
- These Terms, and any rights and licenses granted hereunder, may not be transferred or assigned by you without the prior written consent of Liker Land Inc, and Liker Land Inc's failure to assert any right or provision under these Terms shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision.
- No waiver by either party of any breach or default hereunder shall be deemed to be a waiver of any preceding or subsequent breach or default.
- The section headings used herein are for reference only and shall not be read to have any legal effect.
- The Service is operated by us in the United States. Those who choose to access the Service from locations outside the United States do so at their own initiative and are responsible for compliance with applicable local laws.
